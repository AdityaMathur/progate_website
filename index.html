					<h4>HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT are three basics which are essential for any techy to make a website. They are at the core of the website regardless of its complexity. Even a non-technical person having these three skills can add a spark to their career in whatever field they are. And to our surprise, it is not that tough to get equipped with it. If we talk about HTML, as stated earlier it stands for HyperText Markup Language, which clarifies to an extent that it is not a programming language but it is a language that uses a tag to form a content.

Whereas HTML was the basic structure of your website, CSS is what gives our entire website a unique style. Do you remember those beautiful colours, interesting fonts, and background images? All thanks to CSS. It beautifies the basic structure of the content prepared through HTML. CSS makes it possible to see the web page according to the screen, i.e. on a mobile screen, it will be fitted in the screen as per the size of the mobile phone.</h4>

                <h4 class="next">1. Static webpages</h4>
                <img class="images_1" src="img/static.jpg" ALIGN="left" />A static website is a website which contains Web pages with fixed content. Each page is coded in HTML and displays the same contents to every visitor. Static sites are the most basic type of website and are the easiest to create. Static websites do not require any Web programming or database design.Static web pages are suitable for the contents that never or rarely need to be updated, though modern web template systems are changing this.

                <img class="images_2" src="img/apps.png" ALIGN="right" />A mobile application, also referred to as a mobile app or simply an app, is a computer program or software application designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone, tablet, or watch. Apps were originally intended for productivity assistance such as email, calendar, and contact databases, but the public demand for apps caused rapid expansion into other areas such as mobile games, factory automation, GPS and location-based services, order-tracking, and ticket purchases, so that there are now millions of apps available.

                <h4 class="next">3. Online games</h4>
                <img class="images_3" src="img/game.jpg" ALIGN="left"/>An online game is a video game that is either partially or primarily played through the Internet or any other computer network available.[1] Online games are ubiquitous on modern gaming platforms, including PCs, consoles and mobile devices, and span many genres, including first-person shooters, strategy games and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG).
        The design of online games can range from simple text-based environments to the incorporation of complex graphics and virtual worlds. The existence of online components within a game can range from being minor features, such as an online leaderboard, to being part of core gameplay, such as directly playing against other players. Many online games create their own online communities, while other games, especially social games, integrate the players' existing real-life communities.

Application software (app for short) is a program or group of programs designed for end users. Examples of an application include a word processor, a spreadsheet, an accounting application, a web browser, an email client, a media player, a file viewer, an aeronautical flight simulator, a console game or a photo editor. The collective noun application software refers to all applications collectively. This contrasts with system software, which is mainly involved with running the computer.
