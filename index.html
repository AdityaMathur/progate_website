				<h1>HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT = A perfect web development</h1>
				<p>
					<h4>HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT are three basics which are essential for any techy to make a website. They are at the core of the website regardless of its complexity. Even a non-technical person having these three skills can add a spark to their career in whatever field they are. And to our surprise, it is not that tough to get equipped with it. If we talk about HTML, as stated earlier it stands for HyperText Markup Language, which clarifies to an extent that it is not a programming language but it is a language that uses a tag to form a content.

Whereas HTML was the basic structure of your website, CSS is what gives our entire website a unique style. Do you remember those beautiful colours, interesting fonts, and background images? All thanks to CSS. It beautifies the basic structure of the content prepared through HTML. CSS makes it possible to see the web page according to the screen, i.e. on a mobile screen, it will be fitted in the screen as per the size of the mobile phone.</h4>
